# Java Swing Calculator

A robust calculator application built with Java Swing, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.  
This project demonstrates clean separation of concerns, a modular parsing and evaluation pipeline, and a user-friendly interface.

## üèóÔ∏è Application Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```text
CalculatorApp.java                      // Application entry point
CalculatorModel.java                    // Model: holds state and business logic
CalculatorView.java                     // View: Swing UI
CalculatorController.java               // Controller: connects UI and logic

Parser/                                 // Parsing and evaluation pipeline
    Lexer.java                          // Tokenizes input strings
    Token.java                          // Represents a single token
    TokenType.java                      // Enum for token types
    ShuntingYardParser.java             // Converts infix to postfix (RPN)
    ReversePolishNotationEvaluator.java // Evaluates RPN expressions
```

## üß† Algorithms Used

### 1. **Lexer (Tokenizer)**

- Converts the user's input string into a list of tokens (numbers, operators, parentheses).
- Handles unary plus and minus for negative numbers.

### 2. **Shunting Yard Algorithm**

- Converts infix expressions (e.g., `3 + 4 * 2 / (1 - 5) ^ 2 ^ 3`) into postfix (Reverse Polish Notation, RPN).
- Correctly applies operator precedence and associativity (PEMDAS rules).
- Supports parentheses and all calculator operators.

### 3. **Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Evaluation**

- Evaluates the postfix token list using a stack.
- Handles all supported operators and checks for errors (e.g., division by zero).

## üß© MVC Pattern

- **Model (`CalculatorModel`)**  
  Manages the calculator's state, processes input, validates expressions, and performs evaluation using the parsing pipeline.

- **View (`CalculatorView`)**  
  Displays the calculator UI using Java Swing. Forwards user actions (button presses) to the controller.

- **Controller (`CalculatorController`)**  
  Handles user input, updates the model, and refreshes the view with the latest state.

- **App (`CalculatorApp`)**  
  Wires together the model, view, and controller, and starts the application.

## üö¶ How It Works

1. **User enters input** via the calculator buttons.
2. **Controller** receives the input and passes it to the **Model**.
3. **Model**:
   - Tokenizes the input (`Lexer`)
   - Converts tokens to RPN (`ShuntingYardParser`)
   - Evaluates the result (`ReversePolishNotationEvaluator`)
   - Handles validation and error states
4. **View** displays the updated expression or result.

## üöÄ Potential Future Features

The calculator is designed with extensibility in mind. Here are some planned or possible future updates:

**Keyboard Input Support:**  
  Allow users to enter numbers and operations directly from the keyboard for faster input.

**Expression History:**  
  Display a list of previous calculations and results, making it easy to review or reuse past expressions.

**Highlight Matching Parentheses:**  
  Visually highlight matching parentheses in the input to help users track complex expressions.

**Support for Functions (sqrt, sin, cos, tan):**  
  Add support for common mathematical functions, enabling scientific calculator capabilities.

**Dark Mode:**  
  Provide a dark theme option for improved accessibility and user comfort in low-light environments.
